POST-1::: Docker Lifecycle . 

1.docker images          // shows all images on the host machines
2.docker run hello-world // try to run the image locally if not downloads from the docker-hub.3
3.docker run             // will run the image ,create container and will immediately terminate the container
4.docker ps              // show all active container
5.docker ps -a           // show all active/passive containers
6.docker run --name R--N hello-world 

// giving name to the container else random name are generated for that container.
Note:- if more container are spun from same image it will generate container with ramdom name 


docker -architecture "CTRL + P"

7.docker images tagged as "OFFICIAL" are maintained by docker
8.image name nomenclature
 <REGISTRY>/<REPOSITORY:TAGNAME> // For OFFICIAL images
 <REGISTRY>/<USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY:TAGNAME> // For UN-OFFICIAL images

9.docker pull docker.io/devopstrainer/myrepo1:v6.0
 
Note :: Default REGISTRY NAME is docker.io  

-Metadata/Metainfo for docker is in /var/lib/docker

10.docker pull command will download the image from docker-hub
11.docker run command will download the image and run the container where as pull will just download and not run.
12.docker tag <old image name> <newname>  //rename images
13.docker tag devopstrainer/myrepo1:v6.0 devopsrhavy/collection:v7.0 // renames images copied from devopstrainer/myrepo1:v6.0 to devopsrhavy/collection:v7.0
14.docker push devopsrhavy/collection:v7.0  // will upload image with the following hierarchy

Note : TO push you need to login to you docker account by #docker login cmd

Detached Mode :::

15. docker run -itd ubuntu // container will be running and not ternimated

 Note : -itd -- means iteractive terminal detached mode or default mode 
         and will be active but you cant enter into the container as the name says "detached"
 
16.docker stop container-id/container-name  //will stop the container 
 
17.docker start container-id/container-name // will start the container.

Attached Mode :::

18. docker run -it ubuntu // interactive terminal mode , you will run into the container i.e attached mode 
                          // just as you access machine and is used for some configurations.
						 
Note : type exit you will come out of the container and container will be terminated
       press ctrl+p & ctrl+q  and container will be running .
	   
19. docker attach container-id/container-name 

// will attach you the container same as -it mode and do the config but the container needs to be in running state
 
//# docker start container-id/container-name and then 
//# docker attach container-id/container-name 

20.#docker rm container-id/container-name eg #docker rm sad_booth/R--N

// will remove the container but it should be stopped state .

#docker stop container-id/container-name 
#docker rm -f container-id/container-name
 
21.#docker rmi image-name   

// to remove the images provided no container must be using that image .
// to remove unoffical images that has username/reponame you should use the below syntax

#docker images 
#docker rmi devopsrhavy/collection:v7.0
